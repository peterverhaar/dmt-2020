My dear Leonard,
I have looked up my contract with Doubleday
Doran, and my worst fears have been fulfilled.
I have indeed assigned the Canadian rights to both 
of you. I cannot tell you how sorry I am to have
made this idiotic muddle. I am writing to Mr
Doran today, and will confess my sin and throw
myself on his mercy, suggesting at the same time
that you and he should halve the market.
I am enclosing 10/- which you lent me the
other day. I have a letter from Dottie who is
rather agitated because she has never heard from
you whether you had received the M.S. of her poem,
and what you thought if it. If you want to write
to her, her address for the next days will be:
Kulm Hotel, Col du Simplon, Brigue,
Switzerland

Yours ever
Vita
