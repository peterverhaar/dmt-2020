The names of the sender and the recipient have been entered correctly.
The date has been entered correctly. 
The location of the sender and the location of the recipient have been entered correctly.
The persons mentioned are also correct, although George Doran is mentioned twice in the table (I don't know if that's how it's supposed to be; he's mentioned only once in the letter).
Also, Doubleday Doran comes up in the table, but this is not a person but the name of a publishing company.

The date has also been entered correctly. 
The location of the sender and the location of the recipient have been entered correctly. 
All the persons mentioned in the letter are also present in this table. However, three organisations also turn up in this table, namely R & R Clark, Spalding & Hodge, and Ship Binding Works. 
(Perhaps that's how it should be, and the name 'MENTIONS_PERSONS' is simply throwing me off).
