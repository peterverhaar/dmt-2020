  <h2 style="color: #0000ff;">Fun Facts About Me</h2>
<p>
My sisters and I are triplets. They are identical; I am not. You can still clearly see we are related, though ;).
  <br>  I have a dog named Puck. She's a brown labrador and she's 10 years old. </br>
  <br> I own six copies of <i> Rebecca </i> since it is my favourite novel. That's a lot more copies than any person can reasonably need. </br>
  <br> Occasionally I write in my novels, usually in the ones I love because I know I'll reread those and then it is fun to see what my thoughts were </br>
