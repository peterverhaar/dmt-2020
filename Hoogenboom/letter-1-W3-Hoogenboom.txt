Brandon Street		Very Urgent
Edinburgh

Dear Sirs,

WEST: EDWARDIANS

We shall be obliged if you will print for us immediately
a second impression of 8000 copies of this book. The matter is very
urgent as the book is selling at the rate of nearly 1000 a day. 
We hope to be able to arrange with Messrs Spalding &#x26; Hodge to deliver 
the paper to you on Monday, June 2, but will wire to you about this.
Would you wire to us the earliest possible date at which you could
despatch the sheets to the Ship Binding Works? It may be necessary 
to despatch by fast goods train, but we will wire about this too lat-
er. We shall order 88 reams of the paper and presume that this
will be the quantity you require.

Please note to print Second Impression in small caps on the 
title page, and on back of title page:
First Published May, 1930
Second Impression June, 1930
in italics. We do not wish to see a proof of this if it will delay
the printing.

Yours faithfully,
[handwritten]
