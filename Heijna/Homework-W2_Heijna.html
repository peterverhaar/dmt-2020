  <h1> Annika Heijna </h1>
  <h2> Introduction </h2>
  <p> Hey, my name is Annika. I was born in 1995 in Oegstgeest, which is right next to Leiden. I've lived in Groningen
  for the past 7 years, but I have now returned to Leiden to follow the BDMS programme. I've been interested in Digital Humanities
  for a while, and I recently decided I wanted to try and get into publishing, so this Masters seemed a great fit.
  </p>

  <h2> Study life </h2>
  <p> I have completed two bachelor programmes at the <a href="http://rug.nl"> University of Groningen </a>:
    Philosophy and Dutch Language and Culture, and I am still enrolled in the Philosophy Master Programme,
     because I haven't finished my thesis yet... I've always focused on language, logic and literature in my studies.
     I also - very, very briefly - studied AI in Utrecht, but it turned out that AI was a bit too 'bèta' for my tastes. </p>

  <h2> Languages I know </h2>
     <ul>
       <li> Dutch </li>
       <li> Englisch </li>
       <li> French (basic level) </li>
     </ul>

  <h2> Hobbies </h2>
  <p> Unsurprisingly for someone enrolled in the BDMS programme, I spend most of my time reading.
  I read a lot of Dutch literature, but I´m also a big fan of fantasy and sci-fi. I played volleyball
  for 12 years until I moved to Groningen, where I discovered ballroom and swing dancing. I haven't been able
  to do a lot of dancing recently due to the whole COVID situation, however. I also like to go swimming
or hiking - not running though, I hate running. Lastly, I love playing board, card and video games, so definitely hit me up
if you need someone to play a game with!</p>
