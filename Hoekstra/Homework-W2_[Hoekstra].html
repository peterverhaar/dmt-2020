  <b> Introduction </b>

  <p> My name is Mich√®le and I am 23 years old. I have been living in Leiden
    for 4 years now. Originally I am from Friesland, which is in the North of
    the Netherlands.I graduated from a <a href= https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/education/study-programmes/bachelor/kunstgeschiedenis TARGET="_blank">
    BA in art history </a> (in Leiden) and now
    I am starting my Masters Book and Digital media and Arts & Culture:
    Contemporary art in a global perspective. So I recon it will be a busy
    year for me. I am excited though. Mostly because I am very intruiged by
    how I can intertwine these fields. So I am a student, but I also work
    in a museum (<a href= http://en.museumbredius.nl/ TARGET="_blank"> Museum Bredius </a>) in The Hague. I like switching things up
    and thus besides putting my head only in books I also like to use my knowledge
    in practice. </p>

  <p> I have found, within my BA, that I am very much interested in the
    combination of art and media. There, of course, is a lot of digitalisation
    going on within museums and archives, but also in how art is produced
    (in some cases). Within my BA I have also done an internship for an online
    editorial. Which was a lot of fun and which taught me about the world of
    journalism. </p>

    <b> Languages I speak </b>
    <table>
      <ul>
        <li> Dutch </li>
        <li> English </li>
        <li> French (just a little bit) </li>
        <li> Frisian (I can't speak it, but I do understand it) </li>
      </ul>
    </table>

    <b> My hobbies </b>
    <table>
      <ol>
        <li> Reading </li>
        <li> Watching movies </li>
        <li> Dancing </li>
        <li> Listening to music </li>
        <li> Visiting museums </li>
        <li> Knitting (although I am not particularly good at it) </li>
      </0l>
    </table>

    <body>
    <style> table, th, td {
    border: 1px solid black;
  }
  </style>

<b> What to expect </b>
<br> </br>
<table style= "width:65%">

      <tr>
      <th style="width:20%">Prior knowledge </th>
      <th style="width:20%"> Expectations </th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td style="width:20%"> I followed some media courses within my BA art history:
        <table>
          <ul>
            <li> Digital humanities </li>
            <li> Bookhistory at practice </li>
            <li> Famous Books </li>
            <li> Introduction to journalism </li>
            <li> Internship at <a href=https://www.happinez.nl/lezen/ TARGET="_blank"> Happinez </a> </li>
            <li> And ceveral others </li>
          </ul>
        </table>
So I think I obtained some knowledge in the field of media and the book. But there is definetely more to learn. Especially
for a booklover like me. I especially hope to obtain more knowledge of digitalization within the world of the book.

       </td>
      <td style="width:20%"> I expect to learn the basics of coding within the Digital Media Technologies course. I already
      worked with the programme Wordpress, so I learned to edit and add to websites. I really like puzzling with this. So
    I hope to learn a lot more about coding and webdesign, if that is how you can call it. I also expect to learn more about
  the history and background of how websites, codes, and certain programmes became to what they are nowadays.  </td>
