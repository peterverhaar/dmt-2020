My Dear Leonard,

I was very glad to hear that you were
not giving up the Press and also that you are
hoping to reprint my books before very long.
I think I should like Pepita done first. Would
you be resetting the type? If so I should like
to correct some misprints and also to make a few
minor alterations.

Yours ever,
Vita
