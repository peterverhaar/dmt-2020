My dear Leonard,

This is to introduce Mr. Jullian who is
a French artist and wants to discuss with you
the possibility of illustrating The Edwardians.
I gave him a letter for John Lehman some time
ago but John told him that he was leaving the
Press and as Mr. Jullian was just going back to
France the matter was left in abeyance. He has
now returned to England and will no doubt bring
this nore in person. I have never met him but
I have seen some of his drawings which are
really delightful and would be most suitable
for The Edwardians.

Yours ever,
Vita
