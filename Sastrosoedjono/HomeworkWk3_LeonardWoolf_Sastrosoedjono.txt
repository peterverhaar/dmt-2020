Dear Vita,

Sackville-West: The Edwardians
I enclose a specimen page of THE EDWARDIANS. I am afraid 
it is not on the paper which we shall use because we could not get
it in time. It will be practically the same as that used in ORLANDO

You wont forget about the photo for the jacket?

I saw the Secretary of the Book Society and het will try 
to get a decision in the next week. Hugh returns today

I was glad to hear you have heard of the possibility of
a house in Sussex. But I cannot imagine a more awful blow than
being uprooted from one's house and garden, especially when one has
made them as you have Long Barn.

Yours

Leonard Woolf
