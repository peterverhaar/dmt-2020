The Manager,
Birmingham Repertory Theatre,
Birmingham. September 6th.1934.

Dear Sir,
Miss Sackville-West's Edwardians is, I believe, to 
be produced at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre on Saturday
the 15th inst. We publish a pocket edition of the novel at
3/6d, and I am writing to ask whether you would consider
taking a certain number for sale at the theatre. We could
supply them at a discount of 33 1/3%, and should be glad to pay
carriage.

Yours faithfully,
The Hogarth Press,

Manager.
