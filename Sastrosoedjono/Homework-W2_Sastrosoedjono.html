  <h1>Gessica Sastrosoedjono</h1>

  <p>Hi! I'm Gess and this is my first time ever making something cool like this, so I hope you'll enjoy my page!</p>

<h2>About me</h2>
  <p> I was born and raised in <a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesi%C3%AB">Indonesia</a> and moved to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands">Netherlands</a> about 15 years ago. I speak Dutch quite fluently now,
    however I still don't know what the deal is with 'de' and 'het' and I feel like I will forever guess which definite article to use. I speak three languages (English, Dutch, and Bahasa Indonesia) and can follow basic conversations in German
    and French. I am very interested in languages and I've made it my life's work to learn as many languages as I can!
    I did a Dutch Sign Language course last semester and passed the class (yay!) and I've been learning Korean at home with the help of an amazing site called <a href="https://talktomeinkorean.com/">Talk To Me In Korean</a>.

    <br>
<h2>Academic Interests</h2>
  <p> I finished my BA in <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/education/study-programmes/bachelor/english-language-and-culture">English Language and Culture</a> at the University of Leiden at the beginning of this year,
    with Philology as my specialisation. My thesis discusses the heroic culture of Anglo-Saxon literature within J.R.R. Tolkien's <i>The Children of HÃºrin</i> as I am quite interested in (read: love with a capital L) Tolkien's Legendarium.
      Philology taught me to be curious about the history of one of my most favourite things - books. It introduced me to Manuscript Studies which I find fascinating; I will remember the day when my Philo lecturer - and thesis advisor - dr. Porck
      allowed me to gently touch a medieval manuscript with my bare hands for the first time ever. This is an odd thing to be excited about and I will geek about this wonderful experience that lasted maybe 5 seconds for my entire life. It was then that I decided
      that I want to pursue a career in Manuscript Studies and so here I am, doing the MA Book and Digital Media Studies. :) </p>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
  <p>I'm an ambivert, leaning a bit more towards the introverted side, so I love to be by myself enjoying my hobbies, but also hanging out with my friends - at home. :p
  <p>  I have lots of hobbies to keep myself busy, some of them are:
  <ul>
    <li>Reading</li>
    <li>Listening to music and podcasts</li>
    <li>Watching movies and series</li>
    <li>Spending time with my friends and family</li>
    <li>Finding new restaurants to eat at</li>
    <li>Playing games on the Xbox or Nintendo Switch as well as boardgames</li>
    <li>Finding new hobbies to try, such as water painting, sewing, knitting, etc.</li>
  </ul>

  <p> I used to strongly dislike cats as they always seemed to strongly dislike me as well. However, after living in Leiden for two years and befriending
    all sorts of roaming, friendly cats, I have come to a revelation: everyone is a cat-person, those who deny it aren't ready to face the truth just yet, but that's okay. :)
    Now I have two of the sweetest little gremlins, Nekko and Tina, who always join me in another hobby of mine - napping. <br> <br>
