Dear Sirs,

WEST: EDWARDIANS
Had some cables from our agent in Canada at the end of last week from which I gathered that there had been a protest from your firm against our selling THE EDWARDIANS by Miss V Sackville-West in Canada. As our agreement gave us the Canadian rights, I thought there must be some mistake, but as Miss Sackville-West was arriving from abroad at the end of the week and I expected to see her immediately after her arrival, I waited to speak to her about the matter. She now tells me that, owing to an overnight on her part, she finds that she gave Canadian rights both to us and to your firm. I suggest that under the ircumstances we had better share the market and both sell what we can in Canada. 
I have written to our agent informing him that of how matters stand and that I am in communication with you. 

Yours faithfully, 

Signature
