SACKVILLE WEST. EDWARDIANS (cheap edn.)

Dear Sirs,
Will you kindly estimate for reprinting by Replica process 3000 copies of the above book, imposition for Quod Dexter folding-machine.

I enclose copy of the original cheap edition, and also a copy of the original 7/6 edition. They are both printed from type,
but as they are printed on different paper, you may find the type of the 7/6 edition more satisfactory for your purpose.
Please return with estimate.

At the same time will you let us know whether 33 33 reams Aldwych Ant.Wove Qd.Cr. 30 x 40, 50lbs will be the correct quantity of paper
for printing 3000 copies; and state the time in which the paper can be delivered in London after receipt of paper.

Yours faithfully,

THE HOGARTH PRESS.

MANAGER.
