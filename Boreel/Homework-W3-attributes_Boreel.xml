    Modernism made an impact early in the 20th century century. Artists such as the Frenchman Henri Matisse,
    the Norwegian Edvard Munch (whose 1893 <item type="painting">Scream</item> summed up modern urban alienation) and the
    Austrian Oskar Kokoschka used vivid colours and broad brushstrokes to express mood and emotion,
    and the personal feelings evoked by a situation rather than the way it literally looked. Much avant-garde modernist culture
    – books such as James Joyce's <item type="novel">Ulysses</item>, poems such as T. S. Eliot's <item type="poem">The Waste Land</item> and Ezra Pound's
    <item type="poem">Hugh Selwyn Mauberley</item>, modern art, modern architecture, ballets staged by Sergei Diaghilev – was, for most of the
    first half of the 20th century, only enjoyed by small groups of intellectuals. The public reacted with jeers and contempt
    to Stravinsky’s <item type="ballet">The Rite of Spring</item>, and D.H. Lawrence's <item type="novel">Lady Chatterley's Lover</item> has been banned
    in the UK for several decades. Whereas Pirandello's <item type="play">Six Characters in Search of an Author</item> and Ionesco's
    <item type="play">Rhinoceros</item> shaped the face of modernism in the theatre, their first stagings attracted extremely hostile
    public reactions.
