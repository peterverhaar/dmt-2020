The Hon.V.Sackville West,
Sissinghurst Castle,
Kent.

Dear Vita,

I will look into the question of the rights in "The Edwardians" when I go to the office next week and will let you know
as I presume we still have the agreement, but some of the old ones were lost in the blitz.
I am having a copy of "Pepita" sent to the address you gave.

Yours,
