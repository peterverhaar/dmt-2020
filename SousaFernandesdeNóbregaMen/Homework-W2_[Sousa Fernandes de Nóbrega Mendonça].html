  <p>I am a Portuguese MA Book and Digital Media Studies student at <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl">Leiden University</a>.
   I have a BA (Hons) Photographic Practices from <a href="https://www.beds.ac.uk">University of Bedfordshire</a>.
 </p>
  <p>I am a photographer! My practice can be described as a documentary type of photography. I work within different subjects, focusing more on social and natural landscapes. However, I do have a bigger interest on social issues of today's world.
  </p>
  <p>I am passionate about the concept of imagery accompanied by text, which is common on my projects.
