LONG BARN,

SEVENOAKS.

3rd May, 1929.

My dear Leonard,
 
I am returning the agreement herewith, with
many thanks.

I have a letter this morning from Curtis Brown
in which they say:

"I think Doubleday Doran will be rather 
anxious to have Canada where they have a 
good organisation, and I believe should 
be able to sell the book better thatn an 
English publisher. We excluded Canada 
from Heinemann for this reason. Perhaps 
you will let me have a word about this, 
as the point will have to be cleared up defi-
nitely before the contract can be completed."

I notice that in your agreement you reserve 
the copyright for all countries, other than the United 
States. I am therefore rather puzzled to know what 
I ought to say to Curtis Brown about Canada. Per-
haps you would let me have a line on the subject 
when you have a moment to spare.

[handwritten]
Yours,
Vita
