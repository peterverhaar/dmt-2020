Dear Sirs,

THE EDWARDIANS - Third Impression.
We shall be glad if you will print a third impression, 3000, of the above book, and despatch to the Ship Binding Works as soon as possible as the matter is urgent. Messrs. Spalding & Hodge are delivering to you tomorrow, or Friday, 33 reams of Kingsway Ant. Ld. Cr. Svo. paper, which we believe to be sufficient to print 3000 copies. Kindly note to alter SECOND IMPRESSION to THIRD IMPRESSION on the title page, and on the back of the title page/ add 'third impression' October 1930, in italics. We shall re quire 2750 jackets only as our binders hold a balance of about 300. Please let us know the earlierst date when you will be able to deliver to our binders, so as to enable us to get some idea when we are likely to have the bound copies delivered at the Press. 

Yours faithfully,

The Hogarth Press.
