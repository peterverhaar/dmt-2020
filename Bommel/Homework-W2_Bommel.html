<h1> My 'CV'
</h1>
<p>
 <img src="me.jpg" width = "200" height="200"/>
<p>My name is Martijn van Bommel.
<br/>Currently I am participating in the Master Programme <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/education/study-programmes/master/media-studies/book-and-digital-media-studies">'Book and Digital Media Studies.'</a>
<p>
  <b>Educational background</b>
<br/>
Before starting with the Book and Digital Media programme, I studied at the <a href="https://www.hva.nl"> University of Applied Sciences in Amsterdam </a> and the <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/">University of Leiden.</a>
After graduating from high school, I enrolled in the English Teacher programme in Amsterdam. Then, after finishing the first year, I decided to start with the English Language and Culture BA programme at the University of Leiden.
It is during this programme that I developed quite the interest for books and literature, which eventually led me to the MA programme Book and Digital Media Studies.
