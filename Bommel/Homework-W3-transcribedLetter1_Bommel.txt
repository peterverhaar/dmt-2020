My dear Vita,

V. tells me that you have had an offer with regard to your novel. I feel that we should put our offer on a business footing and that you should not feel that you must accept our terms [unintelligble text] not suggest better if they do not seem adequate. We would pay you a royalty of 15% on the first 3000 copies sold and [unintelligble text] 20% on all copies sold above that number and we would pay you an advance of &#xA3;200 on the day of publication. Presumably you would retain the American rights (which ought to exclude the Canadian rights), but if you wanted us to deal with them we would do so for the [unintelligible text] usual agent&#x27;s commission of 10%.

Yours
