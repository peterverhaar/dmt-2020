    Miss V.Sackville-West,
    Sissinghurst Castle,
    Kent.
    
    Dear Vita,
    
               You were good enough to say that you would agree to a reduction of
    the royalty on "Pepita" for the reprint and reluctantly, I now have to write
    to you about "The Edwardians" which we have brought out at 8/6d. Normally,
    under present circumstances, it would be 10/6d if it were a new book and at
    that price it is just possible to pay a 20&#x25; royalty which it now earns and
    which we ought to pay you.     The account for the last year has just been 
    made out and I find we have sold 1,447 copies of the 2,000 printed.   The
    royalty due to you &#x40; 20&#x25; is &#xA3;120. 5. 0 and our loss is &#xA3;104.16.  6. When we
    have sold the whole edition, whic hwe shall do, your royalties &#x40; 20&#x25; will be
    &#xA3;165 and we shall still have a loss on the whole edition of &#xA3;30.  The thruth
       
       
                                                                                                PTO .
    is that at present pricesit is impossible to pay a royalty of 20&#x25; on a
    long novel &#x40; 8/6d without a loss to the publisher. Would you think it fair
    if we paid you a royalty of 15&#x25; instead of 20&#x25; on this edition? If you think
    it unfair for us to ask you this, I hope you will say spo because I feel, myself,
    that the publisher should really stick to the original agreement even if it
    makes a loss in ordinary curcumstances.
        
                                                   Yours,
