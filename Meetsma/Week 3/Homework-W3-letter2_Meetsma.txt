Dear Sirs,

WEST. EDWARDIANS.

We have received a cable from you which is not very plain, from which we infer that Doubleday Doran complain that the Edwardians by V.Sackville-West is being soldin the English Edition in Canada.
By our Agreement we have the right to sell throughout the world except in th e U.S.A. and therefore we have the right to sell our edition in Canada.

Yours faithfully,
The Hogarth Press.
