Dear Sirs,

Some time ago, you were good enough to lend us your block of Knowle from Knowle and the Sack-villes.
We should be very grateful if we might borrow this once more.
If you are willing to lend it to us again, would you very kindly send it direct to our printers, the Garden City Press Ltd., Letchworth, Herts.?

Yours faithfully,
THE HOGARTH PRESS,
MANAGER.
