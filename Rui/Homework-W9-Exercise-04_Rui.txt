Exercise 4

Explanation of Choices

Every attribute that is a foreign key (FK) takes a value (PK or Code) from another entity. Because numerous entities require values pertaining to geographic location (place of birth, location of institution, etc.), the "City" entity has been created and applied as a foreign key attribute to eliminate redundancy. Also, "Country" has not been applied as an attribute in entities that contain "City" as an attribute, because the "City" entity already contains a "Country" attribute.
