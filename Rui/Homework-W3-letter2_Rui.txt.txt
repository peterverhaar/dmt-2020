Dear Sirs,

WEST : EDWARDIANS.

I have received your letters of 5th September and have cabled to-day to you that we will let you have copies at 2/9 under the circumstances. I am very sorry that this occurred with regard to this book and I feel that it is rather unfortunate for you as it is the first of our books which might have had a really large sale. The fact is, however, that Mrs Nicolson is a personal friend of mine and it was quite impossible for me under these circumstances to take any other line than to agree to share the market with Doran, as it would have put her in a most awkward position if I had insisted upon my rights.

Yours faithfully,
The Hogarth Press.
