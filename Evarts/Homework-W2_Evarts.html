<p> Hello! my name is Sarah Evarts and I am super excited to be studying at Leiden University.</p>
<p>I was born and raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burlington,_Vermont">Burlington Vermont.</a></P>
<p><img src="vermont.jpe"/></p>
<p>I did my undergraduate degree in English Literature and Language at <a href="https://www.queensu.ca/">Queen's University</a>
  in Kingston Ontario. It was there that I developed my
   love of books, not only for their contents, but also for the medium itself!</p>
   <p>After finishing my BA, I worked for a while in publishing servies before deciding I wanted to
     see a bit more of the world.
     Therefore I moved to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest">Budapest, Hungary</a> where I worked as
     an English teacher for several years. I worked at many different schools, but primarily at
     <a href="https://converzum.business.site/">Converzum Language School.</a></p>
