My Dear Vita,
West: Edwardians
We have had some rather big orders from Australia 
and have sold 24,800. We have les than 1000 copies of the 
2nd impression left so I have ordered a third impression of 
3000 copies.
Our Canadian agent is rather upset that we have not stood upon 
our prior rights, but I have told him that that is not possible. 
We have to give discount of 4/3 per copy already on colonial books 
and he presses me to give him 4/9 on THE EDWARDIANS so that he may 
undersell Doran. Under the circumstances I have agreed, but it is 
rather a nuisance as we shall also have to give it for the big 
Australian orders. 
Yours
