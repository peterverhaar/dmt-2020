My dear Leonard,
I thought I would let you know that
"The Edwardians" is going to be produced at
the Birmingham Repertory Theatre on Saturday
September 15th, and would suggest to you
that you might send some copies of the book
up for sale in the theatre.
I am sending Virginia some mushrooms
to-day, because I know how much she likes
them. They were picked at five o'clock this
morning, but not, I regret to say, by me.
Yours ever,
Vita
