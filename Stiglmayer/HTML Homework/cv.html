  <h1>Petra Stiglmayer</h1>
  <img src="me.jpg" height= "300">
  <p>I was born in New York City, but I've spent most of the past four years in the UK where I received my MA in ancient history and archaeology from the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk">University of St. Andrews</a>.
  During this time I also worked on Roman field projects in Italy and North Macedonia, mainly doing excavations and conserving and restoring ceramic and glass artifacts. Although my academic background has little to do with books or digital media studies, I've
always been interested in the history and transmission of the written word and look forward to learning more about it!</p>
  <p>When I'm not working, I usually spend most of my time in the kitchen. I love trying my hand at different cuisines and unfamiliar dishes, even if it takes a few attempts!
    When the weather is nice, I prefer being outside and often go for walks with my cat (when he's cooperative) or tend to my vegetable garden.</p>
