SACKVILLE WEST - THE EDWARDIANS (cheap edn.)


Dear Sirs, 


Will you kindly estimate for reprinting by Replica process 3000 copies of the above, imposition for Quod dexter folding-machine.


I am sending you a copy of the first cheap edition, and also a copy of the original 7/6 edition. They are both printed from type, but as they are on different paper, you may find the 7/6 edition more satisfactory for your purpose. Please return them with your estimate.


At the same time, will you let us know whether 33 reams Aldwych Ant. Wove Qd.Cr.30x40, 50 lbs, will be the correct quantity of paper for the reprint, and also within what time from the receipt of the paper you can promise delivery of the sheets. 
Yours faithfully,
