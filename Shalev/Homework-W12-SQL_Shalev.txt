Letter Q162336219330329
-Sender and Recipient are correct
-Date is correct
-Locations of recipient and sender are correct
-Names referred to:
1. 'SACKVILLE WEST' (Vita Sackville-West) is mentioned in the letter but is not captured properly (I accadentially did not encode her persName code in the original TEI exercise)
2. 'Spalding & Hodge' - I am unable to see if it is captured. I assume this is because it is encoded with orgName (not persName), and therefore it would not appear in MENTIONS_PERSON.
3. 'The Ship Binding works' - Same as 2, see above.
