My name is Mirjam and I was born and raised in Switzerland. My father is Dutch so I grew up with both languages, <b> Dutch </b> and <b> (Swiss)German</b>.
My parents always spoke <b> English</b> with eachother, so I learned to understand English when I was quite young. As my grandmother is <b> Italian</b>,
I learned to speak Italian as well. Although it is not very good, it is good enough for holidays in Italy (which I really love). In school I learned <b> French </b>
and as I like languages, it stuck with me over the past few years so I can still use it when needed. </p>

I started an apprenticeship as a bookseller when I was 16. This means I worked 3-4 days a week and went to school 1-2 days a week.
I worked at a company which had three branches: a publishing group, a distribution centre and 15 bookstores. I worked in every department there,
which gave me a lot of interesting insights into the book industry.
After three years, I finished my apprenticeship and started to work at the distribution centre and the publishing group full time.
At a certain point I got the possibility to organise our visits to bookfairs.
We went to the <a href="https://www.buchmesse.de/en">Frankfurt Bookfair</a>
and the <a href="https://www.leipziger-buchmesse.de/">Bookfair Leipzig</a>. Preparing our stay there was an experience from which I learned a lot and was fun to do!

<p> In 2014 I wanted something new and as I had never experienced the Netherlands
  as my home country, just as a place where I would spend my vacation, I decided to move there.
  I started my BA German Language and Culture in 2016 at <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/">Leiden University</a>. I did my MA German Language and Linguistics in Leiden as well and finished in August 2020.
During my BA and my MA I took some courses with Dr. Jan Hillgärtner, who also taught some courses in the BDMS programme, in which we would learn more about newspapers, book critics and manuscripts. I found those courses very interesting.
In December 2019 I followed a 3-day seminar at Leiden University, organised by the Plantin Institute Antwerpen, with Dr. Goran Proot <a href="http://www.plantininstituut.be/boekwetenschap/">College Boekwetenschap</a>.
These two experiences made me realize that I want to work with books again, which is why I applied for the MA BDMS.
