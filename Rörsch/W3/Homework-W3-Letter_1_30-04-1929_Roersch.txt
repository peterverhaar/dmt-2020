30th April, 1929.
My dear Leonard,

I am so glad that Virginia told you that I had had an offer from Heinemann
with regard to my as yet unwritten, and indeed unconceived, novel,
and I hope that she also told you how horrified I was that Mr. Highham,
with the best intentions in the world, should have offered it to Heinemann.
I need hardly say that I would very much rather publish it through the Hogarth Press,
if you really think that the resources of the Press would
not be too strained by the very liberal offer which you have made me.
At the same time Mr. Higham made me an offer on behalf of Doubleday, Doran,
and as the offer was a good one, I think that I will accept it. You do realise,
 however, that I cannot promise any date for delivery of the M.S.S.
Yours (?) ever
Vita
