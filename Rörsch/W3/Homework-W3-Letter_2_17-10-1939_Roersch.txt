Dear Leonard Woolf,

Thank you for your letter of October 16th.
I am sorry that Miss Sackville-West cannot see her way to agree to our reduced royalty scale, especially as this is now generally accepted; as I expect you know yourself, the standard royalty scale for 6d. editions is 1/4d. per copy.

Yours sincerely,
Allen Lane
