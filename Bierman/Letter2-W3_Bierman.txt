Dear Vita,

THE EDWARDIANS [underlined and overlapping the words printers, paper]
I have dealt with printers, paper-makers, and binders
and have extracted promises from them which will leave
us just time to get the books to the Book Society for
the May publication, but it only just allows sufficient
time and it involves this, that when you get the proofs,
which you ought to do in a day or two, you will have to
pass them and send them back to me immediately and we
shall have to trust the printer to make the corrections
and pass the revise without sending us second proofs.
I am afraid this is the only way in which to do it, but
Clark is an extremely careful printer and I thought you
would rather have this than put the book off till June.
I only hope they keep to their dates, if not it will
be rather disastrous. At any rate, I have told the 
Book Society that we will let them have their 9,000
copies for May 29th.

I really think that Mr. Barker behaved rather
scandalously. He definitely told me that one of the
difficulties was that the book would have to be in
June, and though I pressed him to allow us to have the [the is crossed out]
May and give the other publisher the [the is crossed out] June, he said that
it was impossible.

Yours,
