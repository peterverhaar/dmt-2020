Dear Miss Cooper, 
		Miss Sackvillw-West has asked me to write to 
you and to say that she is quite willing that Thomas Nelson 
and Sons should take the extract from The Edwardians which 
they mention. She does not wish for a fee. 
				
			Yours sincerely,

My dear Leonard, 
	I have just received the enclosed letter 
which speaks for itself. I don't know if there 
is any truth in the rumor that the Press is 
changing hands, although I do not know that John 
Lehmann has left it. I should of course be glad 
if certain of my books could be reprintes, namely 
Pepita, the two books about Persia, The Edwardians 
and All Passion Spent.	Could you let me know 
what the position is and if there is no truth 
in the story that you are giving up the Press, 
please forgive me for having written. 
		
			Yours ever, 
			
				Vita
